      * Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer a 12-week, 26-lesson curriculum all about Machine Learning.
       In this curriculum, you will learn about what is sometimes called **classic machine learning**, using primarily **Scikit-learn**
       as a library and **avoiding deep learning**, which is covered in our forthcoming 
       'AI for Beginners' curriculum. Pair these lessons with 
       our ['Data Science for Beginners' curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners), as well!
